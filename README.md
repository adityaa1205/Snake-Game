## Introduction

This project is a basic version of the Snake game, created to demonstrate the use of Pygame for game development. The player controls a snake, which grows in length when it eats the target. The game ends if the snake goes out of bounds.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls
- Randomly generated targets for the snake to eat
- Increasing snake length as it eats targets
- Game over when the snake goes out of bounds


## Usage

To start the game, run the `snake_game.py` file:

*p.s*-import pygame module first

## How to Play
- Use the W, A, S, D keys to move the snake up, left, down, and right respectively.
- The snake will grow in length each time it eats a target.
- The game ends if the snake moves out of bounds.
